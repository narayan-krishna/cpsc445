ideal scenario -
each sequence is enclosed within partition (no communication)

how is this captured?
each process looks for beginnings and ends -- what does it return?


non-deal scenario-
a sequence starts with an end character
a sequence starts with a begin character but there was a previous begin char

deal with this using communication between ranks
rank 1 has a begin sequence
rank 2 has a begin sequence, then end sequence

rank 1 could notify rank 2 that it has a beginning with no end
